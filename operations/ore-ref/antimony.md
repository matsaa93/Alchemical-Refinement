### Key Points:
- **Stibnite** is the primary antimony mineral and is often associated with **quartz**, **pyrite**, and **arsenopyrite** in hydrothermal veins.
- In **oxidized zones**, stibnite weathers to form secondary antimony oxides like **valentinite**, **senarmontite**, and **cervantite**.
- The mineral assemblage in stibnite deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific stibnite deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., hydrothermal, epithermal, skarn) and guide exploration efforts.
