### Key Points:
- **Bismuthinite** and **native bismuth** are the primary bismuth minerals and are often associated with **galena**, **chalcopyrite**, and **pyrite**.
- In **oxidized zones**, bismuth minerals weather to form secondary minerals like **bismite** and **bismutite**.
- The mineral assemblage in bismuth deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific bismuth deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., hydrothermal, pegmatite, skarn) and guide exploration efforts.
