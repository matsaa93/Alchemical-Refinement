**Pyrite**, also known as "fool's gold," is a common iron sulfide mineral (FeS₂) that often occurs alongside other minerals in various geological environments. The specific minerals associated with pyrite depend on the type of deposit and the geological conditions under which it formed. Below is a list of minerals commonly found with pyrite, categorized by the type of deposit:

---

### 1. **Hydrothermal Veins**:
   - **Quartz**: Pyrite is often found in quartz veins, as quartz is a common gangue mineral in hydrothermal systems.
   - **Chalcopyrite**: A copper iron sulfide mineral (CuFeS₂) that frequently occurs with pyrite in copper deposits.
   - **Galena**: A lead sulfide mineral (PbS) often found in association with pyrite in lead-zinc deposits.
   - **Sphalerite**: A zinc sulfide mineral (ZnS) commonly associated with pyrite in base metal deposits.
   - **Arsenopyrite**: An iron arsenic sulfide mineral (FeAsS) that often occurs with pyrite in gold-bearing veins.
   - **Gold**: Pyrite is frequently associated with gold, especially in epithermal and mesothermal deposits.
   - **Pyrrhotite**: An iron sulfide mineral (Fe₁₋ₓS) that can occur alongside pyrite in sulfide-rich deposits.

### 2. **Sedimentary Deposits**:
   - **Coal**: Pyrite is often found in coal beds, where it forms in reducing environments.
   - **Marcasite**: A polymorph of pyrite (FeS₂) that forms under low-temperature conditions in sedimentary environments.
   - **Calcite**: A common carbonate mineral (CaCO₃) that can occur with pyrite in sedimentary rocks.
   - **Clay Minerals**: Such as kaolinite or illite, often found in shale or mudstone layers containing pyrite.

### 3. **Metamorphic Rocks**:
   - **Garnet**: Pyrite can occur in metamorphic rocks alongside garnet, especially in skarn deposits.
   - **Mica**: Minerals like biotite or muscovite are often associated with pyrite in metamorphic environments.
   - **Magnetite**: An iron oxide mineral (Fe₃O₄) that can form alongside pyrite in metamorphosed iron formations.

---

### 4. **Igneous Rocks**:
   - **Pyrrhotite**: Often found with pyrite in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks.
   - **Pentlandite**: A nickel iron sulfide mineral ((Fe,Ni)₉S₈) associated with pyrite in nickel sulfide deposits.
   - **Magnetite**: Can occur with pyrite in igneous rocks, particularly in layered intrusions.

---

### 5. **Supergene Environments** (Weathered Zones):
   - **Limonite**: A mixture of iron oxides and hydroxides that forms from the weathering of pyrite.
   - **Goethite**: An iron oxyhydroxide mineral (FeO(OH)) that often replaces pyrite in oxidized zones.
   - **Jarosite**: A potassium iron sulfate hydroxide mineral (KFe₃(SO₄)₂(OH)₆) that forms in acidic, oxidized environments where pyrite weathers.

---

### 6. **Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) Deposits**:
   - **Sphalerite**: Commonly associated with pyrite in VMS deposits.
   - **Chalcopyrite**: Often found with pyrite in these deposits.
   - **Barite**: A barium sulfate mineral (BaSO₄) that can occur with pyrite in VMS systems.

---

### 7. **Skarn Deposits**:
   - **Garnet**: Pyrite is often found in skarns alongside garnet.
   - **Wollastonite**: A calcium silicate mineral (CaSiO₃) that can occur with pyrite in skarn environments.
   - **Epidote**: A calcium aluminum iron silicate mineral that is common in skarns.

---

### 8. **Placer Deposits**:
   - **Gold**: Pyrite can be found in placer deposits alongside gold, as both are heavy minerals.
   - **Magnetite**: Often occurs with pyrite in placer deposits due to its high density.

### Key Points:
- Pyrite is a versatile mineral that occurs in a wide range of geological environments.
- The associated minerals depend on the type of deposit (e.g., hydrothermal, sedimentary, metamorphic).
- Pyrite is often an indicator mineral for other valuable minerals, such as gold, copper, and zinc.

If you're studying a specific deposit or location, the mineral assemblage can provide clues about the geological processes that formed it.
