### Key Points:
- **Chalcopyrite** is the primary copper mineral and is often associated with **bornite**, **pyrite**, and **molybdenite** in porphyry deposits.
- In **oxidized zones**, copper sulfides weather to form secondary minerals like **malachite**, **azurite**, and **chrysocolla**.
- The mineral assemblage in copper deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific copper deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., porphyry, VMS, SEDEX) and guide exploration efforts.
