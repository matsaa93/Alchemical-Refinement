**Lead ore** is primarily composed of **galena (PbS)**, the most common and important lead mineral. However, lead ore deposits often contain a variety of other minerals, depending on the geological environment and the type of deposit. These associated minerals can include sulfides, oxides, carbonates, and silicates, as well as other metals like silver, zinc, and copper. Below is a detailed list of minerals commonly found with lead ore, categorized by deposit type:

### Key Points:
- **Galena** is the primary lead mineral and is often associated with **sphalerite**, **pyrite**, and **chalcopyrite**.
- In **oxidized zones**, galena weathers to form secondary lead minerals like **cerussite** and **anglesite**.
- The mineral assemblage in lead deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific lead deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., hydrothermal, SEDEX, MVT) and guide exploration efforts.
