**Zinc ore** is primarily composed of **sphalerite (ZnS)**, the most important and widely mined zinc mineral. However, zinc deposits often contain a variety of other minerals, depending on the geological environment and the type of deposit. These associated minerals can include sulfides, oxides, carbonates, and silicates, as well as other metals like lead, copper, and silver.

### Key Points:
- **Sphalerite** is the primary zinc mineral and is often associated with **galena**, **chalcopyrite**, and **pyrite**.
- In **oxidized zones**, sphalerite weathers to form secondary zinc minerals like **smithsonite** and **hemimorphite**.
- The mineral assemblage in zinc deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific zinc deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., hydrothermal, SEDEX, MVT) and guide exploration efforts.
