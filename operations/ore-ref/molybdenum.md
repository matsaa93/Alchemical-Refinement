**Molybdenum ore** is primarily composed of **molybdenite (MoS₂)**, the most important and widely mined molybdenum mineral. However, molybdenum deposits often contain a variety of other minerals, depending on the geological environment and the type of deposit.

### Key Points:
- **Molybdenite** is the primary molybdenum mineral and is often associated with **chalcopyrite**, **pyrite**, and **quartz** in porphyry deposits.
- In **oxidized zones**, molybdenite weathers to form secondary molybdenum oxides like **ferrimolybdite** and **molybdite**.
- The mineral assemblage in molybdenum deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific molybdenum deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., porphyry, skarn, hydrothermal) and guide exploration efforts.
