**Silver ore** is often found in association with a variety of other minerals, depending on the type of deposit and the geological environment. Silver rarely occurs in its pure, native form; instead, it is typically found in sulfide minerals, as an impurity in other metal ores, or in oxidized zones. Below is a list of minerals commonly associated with silver ore, categorized by deposit type:

### Key Points:
- Silver is often found as an impurity in sulfide minerals like **galena**, **sphalerite**, and **chalcopyrite**.
- In oxidized zones, silver can form secondary minerals like **cerargyrite** or occur as **native silver**.
- The mineral assemblage in silver deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific silver deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., hydrothermal, epithermal, SEDEX) and guide exploration efforts.
