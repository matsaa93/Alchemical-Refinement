### Key Points:
- **Cassiterite** is the primary tin mineral and is often associated with **quartz**, **muscovite**, and **fluorite** in granite-related deposits.
- In **hydrothermal veins**, cassiterite is commonly found with sulfide minerals like **arsenopyrite**, **pyrite**, and **chalcopyrite**.
- In **placer deposits**, cassiterite is often concentrated with other heavy minerals like **magnetite**, **ilmenite**, and **zircon**.
- The mineral assemblage in tin deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific tin deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., granite-related, hydrothermal, placer) and guide exploration efforts.
