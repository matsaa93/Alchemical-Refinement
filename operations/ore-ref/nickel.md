**Nickel ore** is primarily found in two types of deposits: **sulfide deposits** and **laterite deposits**. The minerals associated with nickel ore depend on the type of deposit and the geological environment. Below is a detailed list of minerals commonly found with nickel ore, categorized by deposit type:

---

### 1. **Sulfide Deposits**:
   - **Pentlandite ((Fe,Ni)₉S₈)**: The most important nickel sulfide mineral, often the primary source of nickel in sulfide deposits.
   - **Pyrrhotite (Fe₁₋ₓS)**: An iron sulfide mineral commonly associated with pentlandite.
   - **Chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂)**: A copper iron sulfide mineral often found with nickel sulfides.
   - **Pyrite (FeS₂)**: Iron sulfide, commonly associated with nickel sulfides.
   - **Millerite (NiS)**: A nickel sulfide mineral that can occur in sulfide deposits.
   - **Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)**: An iron oxide mineral often found in sulfide deposits.
   - **Cubanite (CuFe₂S₃)**: A copper iron sulfide mineral that can occur with nickel sulfides.
   - **Violarite (FeNi₂S₄)**: A nickel iron sulfide mineral that forms from the alteration of pentlandite.

### 2. **Laterite Deposits**:
   - **Limonite (FeO(OH)·nH₂O)**: A mixture of iron oxides and hydroxides that often contains nickel in laterite deposits.
   - **Garnierite ((Ni,Mg)₃Si₂O₅(OH)₄)**: A nickel silicate mineral, the primary source of nickel in laterite deposits.
   - **Serpentine (Mg₃Si₂O₅(OH)₄)**: A magnesium silicate mineral often associated with garnierite.
   - **Goethite (FeO(OH))**: An iron oxyhydroxide mineral that can host nickel in laterite deposits.
   - **Hematite (Fe₂O₃)**: An iron oxide mineral found in laterite deposits.
   - **Smectite**: A group of clay minerals that can contain nickel in laterite deposits.

### 3. **Komatiite-Hosted Deposits**:
   - **Pentlandite ((Fe,Ni)₉S₈)**: The primary nickel sulfide mineral in komatiite-hosted deposits.
   - **Pyrrhotite (Fe₁₋ₓS)**: Commonly associated with pentlandite in komatiite-hosted deposits.
   - **Chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂)**: Often found with nickel sulfides in komatiite-hosted deposits.
   - **Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)**: An iron oxide mineral often found in komatiite-hosted deposits.

### 4. **Metamorphic Deposits**:
   - **Pentlandite ((Fe,Ni)₉S₈)**: Can occur in metamorphic deposits.
   - **Pyrrhotite (Fe₁₋ₓS)**: Commonly associated with pentlandite in metamorphic deposits.
   - **Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)**: An iron oxide mineral often found in metamorphic deposits.
   - **Garnet (Ca₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃)**: A silicate mineral that can occur in metamorphic nickel deposits.

---

### 5. **Oxidized Zones (Secondary Enrichment)**:
   - **Garnierite ((Ni,Mg)₃Si₂O₅(OH)₄)**: A nickel silicate mineral that forms in oxidized zones of laterite deposits.
   - **Limonite (FeO(OH)·nH₂O)**: An iron oxide-hydroxide mineral that can host nickel in oxidized zones.
   - **Goethite (FeO(OH))**: An iron oxyhydroxide mineral that can contain nickel in oxidized zones.

### Key Points:
- **Sulfide deposits** are the primary source of nickel, with **pentlandite** being the most important nickel mineral.
- **Laterite deposits** are the second major source of nickel, with **garnierite** and nickel-bearing **limonite** being the key minerals.
- The mineral assemblage in nickel deposits provides clues about the geological processes that formed the deposit.

If you're studying a specific nickel deposit, the associated minerals can help identify the type of deposit (e.g., sulfide, laterite, komatiite-hosted) and guide exploration efforts.
