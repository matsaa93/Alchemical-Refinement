changed:
powdered-ore-*-raw combustibleProps {
"meltingDuration": from 10 to 2,
"smeltingType": "baked" to "convert",
} this makes calcinating the ore faster.

added:
salis-{ "stannic", "antimony", "bismuth", "titanium_trichloride", 
"titanium_tetrachloride", "ferric", "ferrous", "calomel", "argentum", 
"purple_of_cassius", "cupric", "cuprous", "manganese", "zinc",}
vanadium metal
gerhardtite mineral
nitrum nitrates for refining
carbonates added for refining and or endproduct depending on the ore.

variant files added: 
salis "salis.json"
nitrum "nitrum.json"
carbonate "carbonate.json"

Moved:
Saltpeter to Nitrum
Salt of Tartar to carbonate
Salt of Hartshorn to carbonate

Bugs detected:
extra info causes crash is you access the handbook page
for the ore washing pan if it is installed.
needs to be improved, might be that it looks up 
all the panning drops, and struggles with them.

Fixed: 
missing textures for many substances.

TODO:
Create new textures:
Salis
Carbonate
Nitrum
currently uses quartz as texture but needs its own.
