# Alchemical Refinement

---

the mod lets you follow the Alchemical Process to refine ore.

Still a Work In Progress mod.

as of now there is only a panning mechanic and i will try as far as i can to make use of vanilla mechanics for this mod.

I will at some point make another mod that expands on this with C# code but for now this will be the base mod for it.

## The Process:(WIP)

1. Grind ore nuggets in a Grind stone(Quern) to create the powdered ore to make it easier to purify it.

2. Calcinate/Roast in a firepit to remove the volatile impurities.

3. Combine the calcinated ore in to a block in a grid.

4. Washed with the Ore Washing Pan to remove the soluble impurities.

5. Washed block can be broken in to the washed powder.

6. Smelt it in a crucible.

### Known Bugs:

- extra info causes crash is you access the handbook page for the ore washing pan if it is installed.

## NB!

as of now the mod is not Balanced and it might give you a little much for that little effort it takes.

i will rebalance it at some point but i would like some input on that
 so feel free to comment or create a issue on github for that if you 
think it gives to much.

i try to not make it ore double but give you extra ore types based on
 real world geological occurance of minerals and asosiated minerals.

but as of now it will give you around 1.5 increase in yield from the 
base ore item, and some extra ore assosiated with the base ore.
