	"game:alchemical-calcination-title": "First Stage of Alchemy: Calcination",
	"game:alchemical-calcination-text": "<font size=42 weight=bold>Calcination</font><br/><font size=20 weight=bold>The burning away of impurities through intense heat or fire.</font><br/>Calcination is the first stage in the alchemical process of transformation. It involves the burning and breaking down of the raw material or the starting substance through intense heat, usually with the aid of fire. This heat causes the substance to disintegrate and turn into ashes, representing the destruction of the old and impure elements that need to be removed before the process of transformation can begin.<br/><br/>In alchemical philosophy, calcination is also symbolic of the purification of the self. It represents the process of burning away negative traits and beliefs that prevent personal growth and self-realization. This stage requires a willingness to confront and let go of those things that are holding us back, such as fear, anger, and attachments to material possessions.<br/><br/>Calcination is also associated with the element of fire and the astrological sign of Aries. This stage is often represented in alchemical illustrations by a cauldron or a furnace, with flames burning the material inside.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>In the laboratory/Chemical Calcination</font><br/>A substance is heated over an open flame or in a crucible until it is reduced to ashes. Alchemists considered acids, especially Vitriol, as a kind of liquid fire that also was considered a process of Calcination. Vitriol is a thick green substance that forms from the weathering of sulfur-bearing rocks. It is a combination of iron and sulfuric acid that fascinated the alchemists. Sulfuric acid became the fire that drove hundreds of chemical reactions. It is a powerful corrosive that eats away flesh and all metals except gold.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Psychologically Calcination</font><br/>This operation involves the destruction of ego and our attachments to material possessions. Calcination is usually a natural humbling process as we are gradually assaulted and overcome by the trials and tribulations of life, though it can be a deliberate surrender of our inherent hubris gained through a variety of spiritual disciplines that ignite the fire of introspection and self- evaluation. In society, the Calcination is expressed in the lives of revolutionaries, conquerors, and other warriors who try to overthrow the status quo.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Physiologically Calcination</font><br/>The Fire of Calcination can be experienced as the metabolic discipline or aerobic activity that tunes the body, burning off excesses from overindulgence and producing a lean and efficient body. Bodily Calcination begins in the Base or Lead Chakra at the sacral cup at the base of the spine. On the planetary level, it is the Fire of creation, the formation of a livable environment from molten matter and volcanic ashes.<br/><br/>",
	
	"game:alchemical-dissolution-title": "Secound Stage of Alchemy: Dissolution",
	"game:alchemical-dissolution-text": "<font size=42 weight=bold>Dissolution</font><br/><font size=20 weight=bold>The breaking down of the remaining material into a solution.</font><br/>Dissolution is the second stage of alchemy, which follows calcination. Once the alchemist has burned away the impurities and distractions in the calcination stage, they then proceed to dissolve the remaining matter. This process involves breaking down the remaining substance into a liquid or solution. In the alchemist’s laboratory, this might involve dissolving a solid substance in water or other solvents. In the context of personal growth and transformation, dissolution may involve breaking down psychological barriers or defenses, allowing the individual to confront and work through their inner conflicts and emotional blockages. This stage can be emotionally intense, as it requires an individual to let go of attachments and patterns that no longer serve them. Dissolution is often associated with the element of water, which represents the power of fluidity and adaptability.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>In the laboratory/Chemical Dissolution</font><br/>The second operation involves dissolving the ashes from Calcination in water, acid, or other solution. These ashes are sometimes called the Salt of the Stone (Sal Salis), which is the inner matrix that carries all the essences that later become the Philosopher’s Stone. In summing up the important transition from the operation of Calcination to the operation of Dissolution.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Psychologically Dissolution</font><br/>Is the continuance of the kundalini experience, the opening-up of energy channels in the body to recharge and elevate every single cell. Dissolution takes place in the Genital or Tin Chakra and involves changes in the lungs and spleen. On the planetary level, Dissolution is the Great Flood, the cleansing of the earth of all that is inferior.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Physiologically Dissolution</font><br/>Represents a further breaking down of the artificial structures of the psyche by total immersion in the unconscious, the rejected part of our consciousness. Within the alchemist, the dissolving Water of Dissolution can take the form of dreams, voices, visions, and strange feelings which reveal a less ordered and less rational world existing simultaneously with our everyday life. During Dissolution, the conscious mind lets go of control to allow the surfacing of buried material and tied up energy. Dissolution can be experienced as flow, the bliss of being well-used and actively engaged in creative acts without personal hang-ups or established hierarchy getting in the way. In society, the process of steady growth through gradual Dissolution is exemplified by monastic, nature-based, or agrarian lifestyles.<br/><br/>",
	
	"game:alchemical-separation-title": "Thrid Stage of Alchemy: Separation",
	"game:alchemical-separation-text": "<font size=42 weight=bold>Separation</font><br/><font size=20 weight=bold>The removal of any remaining impurities from the solution.</font><br/>Separation is the third stage in the alchemical process, and it involves the removal of any remaining impurities from the solution after the calcination and dissolution stages. This process involves separating the purified substance from any non-essential elements or impurities that may still be present. In alchemy, separation can also refer to the separation of the different parts of a compound, which can then be worked with individually to achieve the desired result. This stage is crucial as it ensures that the substance is free from any impurities that could hinder its transformation into a higher form.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>In the laboratory/Chemical Separation</font><br/>Is the isolation of the components of Dissolution by filtration or fractional distillation and then discarding any impure or unworthy material. It is the isolation of the desired components from the previous two purification operations (Calcination and Dissolution). In the laboratory, the components of the polluted solution from Dissolution are separated out by filtration, cutting, settling, or agitation with air. Any dead or unworthy material is then discarded.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Psychologically Separation</font><br/>Is the rediscovery of our essence and the reclaiming of dream and visionary gold previously rejected by the masculine, rational part of our minds. It is, for the most part, a conscious process in which we review formerly hidden material and decide what to discard and what to reintegrate into our refined personality. Much of this shadowy material is things we are ashamed of or were taught to hide away by our parents, churches, and schooling. Separation is letting go of the self-inflicted restraints to our true nature, so we can shine through. The process of Separation retrieves the frozen energy released from the breaking down of habits and crystallized thoughts (assumptions, beliefs, and prejudices) and hardened feelings (emotional blockages, neuroses, and phobias). This misspent energy is now available to drive our spiritual transformation. In Society, Separation is expressed as the establishment of clans, cities, and nationalities.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Physiologically Separation</font><br/>Is following and controlling the breath in the body as it works with the forces of Spirit and Soul to give birth to new energy and physical renewal. Separation begins in the Navel or Iron Chakra located at the level of the solar plexus. Separation on the planetary level is represented by the formation of landmasses and islands from the powerful forces of Air, Water, Earth, and Fire.<br/><br/>",
	
	"game:alchemical-conjunction-title": "Fourth Stage of Alchemy: Conjunction",
	"game:alchemical-conjunction-text": "<font size=42 weight=bold>Conjunction</font><br/><font size=20 weight=bold>The union of purified substances to create something new.</font><br/>Conjunction, the fourth stage of alchemy, involves the union of two or more purified substances to create something new. This stage can be seen as the synthesis of the previous stages, where the purified elements are brought together to form a new whole. This stage requires a deep understanding of the nature of the substances involved and their potential for transformation. The union of these substances is often seen as a metaphor for the union of opposites within oneself, leading to a greater sense of wholeness and integration. In this stage, the alchemist works to find a balance between opposing forces, recognizing that each has its own unique qualities that can be combined to create something new and transformative.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>In the laboratory/Chemical Conjunction</font><br/>Is the recombination of the saved elements from Separation into a new substance. Often this was a forced marriage done by fusing or amalgamating metals or by mixing saved components in a new chemical reaction by the addition of a temporary mediator such as an acid or a catalyst.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Psychologically Conjunction</font><br/>Is empowerment of our true selves, the union of both the masculine and feminine sides of our personalities into a new belief system or an intuitive state of consciousness. The alchemists referred to it as the Lesser Stone, and after it is achieved, the adept is able to clearly discern what needs to be done to achieve lasting enlightenment. Often synchronicities begin to occur at this stage that confirm the alchemist is on the right track in his or her personal transformation. In society, it is the growth of crafts and technology to master the environment.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Physiologically Conjunction</font><br/>Is using the body’s sexual energies for personal transformation. Conjunction takes place in the body at the level of the Heart or Copper Chakra. On the planetary level, Conjunction occurs when primordial life forms are created from the energy of the Sun or lightning.<br/><br/>",
	
	"game:alchemical-fermentation-title": "Fifth Stage of Alchemy: Fermentation",
	"game:alchemical-fermentation-text": "<font size=42 weight=bold>Fermentation</font><br/><font size=20 weight=bold>The process of allowing the new substance to mature and develop.</font><br/>Fermentation is the fifth stage of alchemy, where the newly created substance undergoes a period of maturation and development. This stage is often compared to the process of brewing or fermenting beer, where yeast and other microorganisms transform the mixture over time. In alchemy, the fermenting process is seen as a time of growth, where the substance develops and becomes more complex. This stage can involve both physical and spiritual growth, as the alchemist continues to work on themselves and their understanding of the substance they are creating. It is also seen as a time of patience and waiting, as the process cannot be rushed and must be allowed to unfold naturally.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>In the laboratory/Chemical Fermentation</font><br/>Begins with the rotting of the plant material or substance of transformation. The alchemists often added manure to help get the process going. The sign that Putrefaction is nearing its end is a milky white fluid that appears like a tunnel of white light in the black, rotting material. The dead material seems to come to life again with an influx of digesting bacteria, as Fermentation begins. This is the introduction of new life into the product of Conjunction to revive and rejuvenate it in a process of spiritization. Finally, out of the utter blackness of Putrefaction comes the yellow Ferment, which appears like a golden wax flowing out of the foul matter. Chinese alchemists called this substance the Golden Pill, which marked their intermediary Yellow Phase (the Xanthosis), a alchemical transition also recognized by Alexandrian alchemists. The production of the Ferment or Golden Pill is heralded by the formation of an iridescent, oily film the alchemists named the Cauda Pavonis (Peacock’s Tail).<br/><br/>We see this process most clearly in the making of wine. First, the grapes are “sacrificed” or crushed to release their essences in the juice. Then, Putrefaction begins as the juice is allowed to decompose and rot. Next, a white layer of digesting bacteria arises that begins the process of Fermentation. This phase is also sometimes marked by waxy substance the alchemists called the Ferment and an oily film known as the Peacock’s Tail. Finally, the new life force “conquers” the original identity of the grape juice and supplants it with a new and higher presence or life. This higher presence is release during the next operation (Distillation), which produces the true Spirit of Wine (its alcohol), which contains the purified essence of grapes.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Psychologically Fermentation</font><br/>This process is the death of the feeble (or unstable) Child of the Conjunction that will eventually result in its resurrection to a new level of being. Fermentation starts with the inspiration of spiritual power from Above that reanimates, energizes, and enlightens the alchemist. Out of the blackness of the alchemist’s despair (Putrefaction) comes a brilliant display of colors and meaningful visions (the Peacock’s Tail.) Fermentation can be achieved through various activities that include intense prayer, desire for mystical union, breakdown of the personality, transpersonal therapy, psychedelic drugs, and deep meditation. Thus, personal Fermentation is living inspiration from something totally beyond us. In society, the Fermentation experience is the basis of religion and mystical awareness.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Physiologically Fermentation</font><br/>Is the rousing of living energy (chi or kundalini) in the body to heal and vivify. It is expressed as vibratory tones and spoken truths emerging from the Throat or Mercury Chakra. On the planetary level, it is the evolution of life to produce consciousness in matter.<br/><br/>",
	
	"game:alchemical-distillation-title": "Sixth Stage of Alchemy: Distillation",
	"game:alchemical-distillation-text": "<font size=42 weight=bold>Distillation</font><br/><font size=20 weight=bold>The separation and concentration of the pure essence of the substance.</font><br/>Distillation is the sixth stage of alchemy, where the fermented substance is heated and the pure essence is separated and concentrated. The process of distillation involves boiling the mixture and capturing the vapors, which are then condensed back into a liquid form. This process allows the alchemist to separate the pure essence of the substance from any remaining impurities or byproducts. In a spiritual sense, distillation represents the purification of the self and the refinement of one’s inner qualities. It is a time of intense focus and concentration, as the alchemist strives to distill the essence of their being into its purest form. This stage requires precision and attention to detail, as even a small error can result in a loss of the pure essence.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>In the laboratory/Chemical Distillation</font><br/>Is the boiling and condensation of the fermented solution to increase its purity, which is why this is known as the White Stage of alchemy. Psychologically, this agitation and sublimation of psychic forces is necessary to ensure that no impurities from the lower personality are incorporated into the next and final process. (It rises from Earth to Heaven and descends again to Earth) is how the tablet describes Distillation, which represents the second or higher application of the Water Element in the tablet. The alchemists thought of this phase as working with the heavenly substance Mercury to extract and refashion the metals. The Ferment, the soft amalgam or balsam resulting from this operation must be hardened into a Stone before it can be made permanent, and the final phase of Distillation is a Sublimation in which vapor turns solid, or the spirit is made corporeal. Chemical Distillation is the boiling and condensation of a solution to increase its concentration and purity. Chemically, it is the boiling and condensation of the fermented solution to increase its purity, such as takes place in the distilling of wine to make brandy.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Psychologically Distillation</font><br/>Is the agitation and sublimation of psychic forces is necessary to ensure that no impurities from the inflated ego or deeply submerged id are incorporated into the next and final stage. Personal Distillation consists of a variety of introspective techniques that raise the content of the psyche to the highest level possible, free from sentimentality and emotions, cut off even from one’s personal identity. Distillation is the purification of the unborn Self -- all that we truly are and can be. In society, the Distillation experience is expressed as science and objective experimentation.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Physiologically Distillation</font><br/>Is raising the life force repeatedly from the lower regions in the cauldron of the body to the brain (what Oriental alchemists called the Circulation of the Light), where it eventually becomes a wondrous solidifying light full of power. Distillation is said to culminate in the Third Eye area of the forehead, at the level of the pituitary and pineal glands, in the Brow or Silver Chakra. On the Planetary level, Distillation is the realization of the power of higher love, as the life force on the entire planet gradually seeks to become one force in nature based on a shared vision of Truth.<br/><br/>",
	
	"game:alchemical-coagulation-title": "Seventh Stage of Alchemy: Coagulation",
	"game:alchemical-coagulation-text": "<font size=42 weight=bold>Coagulation</font><br/><font size=20 weight=bold>The solidification of the purified essence into a new form or state.</font><br/>Coagulation is the final stage of alchemy and involves the solidification of the purified essence into a new form or state. This stage can be seen as the culmination of the alchemical process, where the newly created substance has been refined, purified, and transformed. Coagulation is often associated with the physical manifestation of spiritual transformation, as the purified essence is made tangible and visible. This stage can involve the creation of a physical object, such as a crystal or stone, that represents the culmination of the alchemical process. Coagulation is also associated with the integration of the self, where the purified essence is integrated into the individual, resulting in a new state of being or consciousness. This stage is seen as the ultimate goal of the alchemical process, where the alchemist has achieved personal transformation and growth.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>In the laboratory/Chemical Coagulation</font><br/> In alchemical metallurgy, the baser metals are transformed into incorruptible gold during this stage. In many alchemical experiments, Coagulation is the precipitation or sublimation of the purified Ferment from Distillation. Can refare to the Crystallization of a substance. Just as drops coalesce to form a river, coagulation is the final step in alchemy. Elements solidify into a new creation – the culmination of the alchemical masterpiece. It symbolizes achieving the highest potential, a reflection of the culmination of our own life's journey.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Psychologically Coagulation</font><br/>Is first sensed as a new confidence that is beyond all things, though many experience it as a Second Body of golden coalesced light, a permanent vehicle of consciousness that embodies the highest aspirations and evolution of mind. Coagulation incarnates and releases the Ultima Materia of the soul, the Astral Body, which the alchemists also referred to it as the Greater or Philosopher’s Stone. Using this magical Stone, the alchemists believed they could exist on all levels of reality. In society, it is the living wisdom in which everyone exists within the same light of evolved consciousness and knowledge of Truth.<br/><br/><font size=24 weight=bold>Physiologically Coagulation</font><br/>Is marked by the release of the Elixir in the blood that rejuvenates the body into a perfect vessel of health. A brain ambrosia is said to be released through the interaction of light from the phallic-shaped pineal gland and matter from the vulva of the pituitary. This heavenly food or viaticum both nourishes and energizes the cells without any waste products being produced. These physiological and psychological processes create the Second Body, a body of solid light that emerges through the Crown or Gold Chakra. On the planetary level, Coagulation is a return to the Garden of Eden, this time on a higher level in tune with the divine mind.<br/><br/>",
